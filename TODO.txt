Today:
	Add ball-ball spin interaction
	


Known issues:

0) Keep tweaking variables


Known bugs
	holding still sometimes produces a (weak) drag.
	dragging is relatively unreliable in the predicted motion. 
minor bugs
	Text stuff
	Sounds
	There is a bloat of constants :(


DELTA TIME IS ALWAYS A CONSTANT PROBABLY AS A RESULT OF US CHANGING WHAT TIME MEANS
Today
IMPROVING PERFORMANCE
	1) See what options exist for profiling. 




Tomorrow
1) Add server communication to check "global" high scores. 
	Update the priviliges to reflect this new desire to 
	use the network. 
	Look up what NameValuePairs are and how they work. 	


2) Make the touch radius a property of the ball instead of the click
   so that regular balls can have a larger touch radius and the tennisballs
   can have a smaller one, making them harderrrr.

3) Check for collisions between balls at time t0 and t1.

4) Cut the sounds so that they are more responsive
	

Luxury:
	Move review lines to a separate file to be read. 
	Rewrite the endscreen drawing to be relative to fit different layouts.
	

WRITE A MARCOV PREDICTOR MIXER OF SOME BRAINDEAD POPSTAR AND MARX
Fix UI in general



Most likely the laggy behaviour is due to poor performance of the 
emulator. The likely solution is to use a real android phone, but
the smoothing discussed at 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10648325/android-smooth-game-loop
seems very interesting. 

Look up ragdoll implementation

1) Add some custom modes to the tennis balls.
	No gravity mode
     	Slow speed mode
     	Wacky movement mode (quantum balls?)
	Double scoring
	Double speed
	Add life
	Inverse gravity mode
	ball attraction mode
	ball reppellation mode
	Flubber mode
    	etc etc

That's enuff for now.
