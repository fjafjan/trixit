Known issues:

0) Keep tweaking variables

Today



Tomorrow
1) Add server communication to check "global" high scores. 

2) Fix dragging including spin

3) Make the touch radius a property of the ball instead of the click
   so that regular balls can have a larger touch radius and the tennisballs
   can have a smaller one, making them harderrrr.

4) Check for collisions between ball movement. 

4) Print FPS

5) Cut the sounds so that they are more responsive
	
Known bugs:
    Swiping doesn't swipe, only clicks multiple times. 
	On Glazes phone, holding does not detect as a held touch.     

Luxury:
	Move review lines to a separate file to be read. 
	Rewrite the endscreen drawing to be relative to fit different layouts.
	

WRITE A MARCOV PREDICTOR MIXER OF SOME BRAINDEAD POPSTAR AND MARX
Fix UI in general



Most likely the laggy behaviour is due to poor performance of the 
emulator. The likely solution is to use a real android phone, but
the smoothing discussed at 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10648325/android-smooth-game-loop
seems very interesting. 

Look up ragdoll implementation

1) Add some custom modes to the tennis balls.
	No gravity mode
     	Slow speed mode
     	Wacky movement mode (quantum balls?)
	Double scoring
	Double speed
	Add life
	Inverse gravity mode
	ball attraction mode
	ball reppellation mode
	Flubber mode
    	etc etc

That's enuff for now.
