Known issues:
Clicking results in 3 points awarded seemingly every time
Clicking is unresponsible

Steps for locating bugs:
Remove number of lives (set to inf)
We want to know position before and after colission?	

1) Keep tweaking variables, check that time sensitivity is actually working

2) Publish	

3) Add a nicer number of lives indicator

4) Add tennis balls with bonuses
     Add a destroy variable that is checked at some point and use it.
     Add drawing and colission with TennisBall
     No gravity mode
     Slow speed mode
     Wacky movement mode?
     etc etc
	
4) Print FPS

5) Cut the sounds so that they are more responsive

6) Consider that a swipe could hit multiple bals. 
Known bugs:
    New dist and old dist return different answers? unclear as heck why.
    

WRITE A MARCOV PREDICTOR MIXER OF SOME BRAINDEAD POPSTAR AND MARX
Fix UI in general


Change ballSize, gravity etc to be synced between classes, currently it's baed.

Add spin

Most likely the laggy behaviour is due to poor performance of the 
emulator. The likely solution is to use a real android phone, but
the smoothing discussed at

seems very interesting. 

Look up ragdoll implementation

That's enuff for now.
