Known issues:

0) Keep tweaking variables


1) Add tennis balls with bonuses
     Add some custom modes.
	No gravity mode
     	Slow speed mode
     	Wacky movement mode (quantum balls?)
	Double scoring
	Double speed
	Add life
	Inverse gravity mode
	ball attraction mode
	ball reppellation mode
    	etc etc


3) Make the touch radius a property of the ball instead of the click
   so that regular balls can have a larger touch radius and the tennisballs
   can have a smaller one, making them harderrrr.



4) The "inball" function in nice, but I think for the purposes
   of collisions, it's nicer to have a special checkCollisions
   function that first off doesn't do the extra work of checking
   for everything twice, and moreover it doesn't require the 
   rather ugly method of returning collision with self most of 
   the time. I don't think it is sufficiently advanced to justify
   such ugliness. Perhaps isntead one could write shorter functions
   that do some of the "trickier" parts of its job. 
	
2) Add server communication to check "global" high scores. 

1) Change background

4) Print FPS

5) Cut the sounds so that they are more responsive

Known bugs:
    Swiping doesn't swipe, only clicks multiple times. 
    

WRITE A MARCOV PREDICTOR MIXER OF SOME BRAINDEAD POPSTAR AND MARX
Fix UI in general


Add spin

Most likely the laggy behaviour is due to poor performance of the 
emulator. The likely solution is to use a real android phone, but
the smoothing discussed at 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10648325/android-smooth-game-loop
seems very interesting. 

Look up ragdoll implementation

That's enuff for now.
